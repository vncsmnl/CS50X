Working on these SQL practice queries was great for improving my SQL skills. It challenged me to think about how to use different SQL clauses such as JOIN, ORDER BY, LIMIT, etc., to extract specific pieces of information from a database.

Writing the queries required carefully reading each question to understand exactly what data needed to be returned. I had to think about how the tables were related to each other through keys such as artist_id. Joining the song and artist tables was necessary for some queries in order to get data from both tables.

I made a few mistakes initially in the syntax, for example forgetting to specify the table name for the columns. The error messages helped me improve, for example, realizing that I needed to sort the LIMIT after the ORDER BY clause. Practicing these queries and correcting the errors through the iterative process taught me a lot.

Thinking about how Spotify can use similar queries on its own data to generate insights for its annual Wrapped summaries was interesting. It demonstrated how SQL can be used to analyze real-world data.

Overall, the hands-on practice of writing and executing SQL queries for different needs was an excellent experience. Debugging errors by checking table structures and query syntax was extremely valuable. I've definitely improved my SQL skills through this exercise and feel more confident about my work.
